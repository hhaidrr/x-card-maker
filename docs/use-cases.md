# Use Cases

1. Generate/create shareable digital business cards that can be stored in apple wallet.

2. I can share business card from my apple wallet to someone elses apple wallet either by:
    a. NFC phone to phone contact
    b. the other person scans my shareable business card.

NOTE: the other person opens the business card and gets sent to the persons linktree or social media account of their choosing.

## target market
People at booths at conferences that need to share their socials and contacts with people they meet in a convenient and fast way.
The advantage over physical business cards is that often physical cards become lost or tossed in the trash. Cards that end up in your digital wallet cannot be lost. They have to be intentionally deleted. Instead of requiring a QR code scan. The user can always use the card to travel to the social link on the digital card.
